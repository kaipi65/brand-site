<h1>About Benjiem</h1>

<p>
I build practical AI systems and automation tools that solve real-world problems. 
My work focuses on AI agents, workflow automation, and scalable internet infrastructure.

<p>
This site is my digital lab — a place where I document experiments, share technical insights, 
and publish small but useful tools. I believe the future belongs to builders who combine 
artificial intelligence with efficient execution.
